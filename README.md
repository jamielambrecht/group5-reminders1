## ***05-01 Auto-refresh update 2**

Streamlined auto-refresh functions:

Press
Refresh notifications
Disabled alert if auto-renew is not on 

Long press
delete all non-recurring notifications for this reminder (autorenew on)
delete all notifications for this reminder (autorenew off)

Added a custom logo to notifications

Performance should be better now

May push one more update if I get around to note pinning

## ***05-01 Auto-refresh improvements**

Statuses for reminders that expired while the app was closed should now be properly synced upon restarting the app

Feature improvement to notification auto-refresh by making it automated and accurately enable/disable.

Auto-refresh Button
Press = clear notifications for reminder
Long press = turn on auto-refresh

Improved performance on android AVDs, more testing needed here

Fixed a typo where a reminder became expired after ~5.5 min instead of ~55.5 min of lateness

**_TODO:_**
**iron out bugs and stuff**
**Test for wonkiness and stability**
**Integrate with new UI features**

## **04-30 Auto-renew beta final**

Crashes and memory leaks due to deleted objects should be fixed now.

The app now polls renewal statuses every **~~60~~ ==> _30_** seconds for closer to live updates.

Properly set the grace period for expired stuff. Beyond these time windows, objects are past-expired.
Auto-renew: **55.55 minutes**
Notify: **59 minutes**

You can only turn on auto-renew if the reminder isn't past-expired.

You can only turn on notifications if the reminder / subtask isn't past-expired.

Fixed a notification display bug where _reminder.title_ was literally showing that

Made it so most notifications cancel as soon as you click on them to reduce annoyance.

Removed most popup alerts except those concerning renewal or disabled functionality

Renew button updates the notification timestamps if the reminder has been auto-renewed (only has an effect if auto-renew is on)

Probably final update for the weekend barring hotfixes
